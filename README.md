## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key dependencies include:
- `win10toast_click` - For proper Windows notification branding
- `flask` - Web interface
- `pynput` - Keyboard/mouse monitoring
- `psutil` - System monitoring
- `requests` - For AI model communication

### 2. Start the System

#### 2: Web Interface + Tracker
```bash
python app.py
```
- Starts web interface at http://localhost:5000
- Includes all features: custom alerts, testing, session management, AI insights

#### 1: Tracker Only
```bash
python tracker.py
```
- Starts background tracker with GUI
- Monitors productivity and triggers alerts
- Automatically registers SnapAlert with Windows

### 3. Create Custom Alerts

1. Open the web interface: http://localhost:5000
2. Go to **Settings** → **Custom Alerts**
3. Click **"+ Create Alert"** and configure:
   - **Name**: Short descriptive name (e.g., "Drink Water")
   - **Type**: Choose from session_time, app_time, keystroke_count, idle_time
   - **Condition**: greater_than, less_than, or equal_to
   - **Threshold**: Numeric value (minutes for time, count for keystrokes)
   - **Message**: Alert text (can use {threshold} and {app} placeholders)
   - **App Filter**: Optional app name filter
4. Click **"Test"** to test your alert immediately
5. Enable the alert to have it monitored automatically

### 4. Set Up AI Intelligence

1. Ensure you have a local AI model running (e.g., Ollama with Mistral)
2. Configure your work goals in the web interface
3. The system will automatically:
   - Analyze your productivity patterns
   - Generate personalized insights
   - Trigger goal-based notifications
   - Provide actionable suggestions

### 5. Use Your System

After setup:
- **Live Dashboard**: Watch real-time session tracking at http://localhost:5000
- **Automatic Alerts**: Custom alerts trigger automatically based on your conditions
- **AI Insights**: Get personalized productivity suggestions
- **Goal Notifications**: Receive AI-triggered reminders based on your goals
- **Manual Testing**: Click "Test" buttons to test any alert
- **Notifications**: All appear as "SnapAlert:" in Windows notifications

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Monitoring (tracker.py)

- Set up AI Intelligence. [AI Intelligence](ai_analysis/README.md)

### 2. Custom Alert Format (data/custom_alerts.json)
```json
{
  "id": "1703123456789",
  "name": "Drink Water",
  "type": "session_time",
  "condition": "greater_than",
  "threshold": 30,
  "message": "Time to drink water! You've been working for {threshold} minutes.",
  "enabled": true,
  "app_filter": "",
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "last_triggered": 1703123456.789,
  "trigger_count": 5
}
```


### 3. Notification System
- **Primary Method**: `win10toast_click` (proper app source control)
- **Fallback 1**: PowerShell Toast notifications (with registered app ID)
- **Fallback 2**: `plyer` notifications
- **Fallback 3**: `win10toast` (final fallback)
- **Automatic Registration**: System registers "SnapAlert.ProductivityMonitor" with Windows

### 4. Alert Prevention
- **Anti-Spam**: Same alert won't trigger within 5 minutes
- **Smart Filtering**: Excludes system apps from idle alerts
- **Condition Checking**: Evaluates greater_than, less_than, equal_to conditions
- **Placeholder Replacement**: Replaces {threshold}, {app}, {value} in messages
